//! A crate for generating arrays of prime numbers at compile time.
//!
//! `#![no_std]` compatible.
//!
//! The crate is currently split into two modules, [`trial`] and [`sieve`], which contain implementations of
//! prime related `const` functions that use [trial division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division)
//! or the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) in their implementations respectively.
//!
//! The sieve needs `O(n)` memory, which means that the functions in the [`sieve`] module
//! need a const generic to be specified in order to compile.
//!
//! The implementations in [`trial`] are slower, but do not need const generics unless they return an array.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ## Prime generation
//! Generate arrays of prime numbers with the function [`trial::primes`](crate::trial::primes)
//! ```
//! use const_primes::trial::primes;
//! const PRIMES: [u32; 10] = primes();
//! assert_eq!(PRIMES[5], 13);
//! assert_eq!(PRIMES, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]);
//! ```
//! or with the type [`wrapper::Primes`](crate::wrapper::Primes)
//! which ensures that a non-zero number of primes are generated
//! ```
//! use const_primes::wrapper::Primes;
//! const PRIMES: Primes<10> = Primes::new();
//! assert_eq!(PRIMES[5], 13);
//! assert_eq!(PRIMES, [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]);
//! ```
//! Creating a `Primes<0>` is a compile fail in const contexts and a panic otherwise.
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use const_primes::wrapper::Primes;
//! const PRIMES: Primes<0> = Primes::new();
//! ```
//! ## Primality testing
//! There is one implementation of `is_prime` in [`trial`] and one in [`sieve`]
//! ```
//! use const_primes::{trial, sieve};
//! const CHECK_5: bool = trial::is_prime(5);
//! const CHECK_1009: bool = sieve::is_prime::<1009>();
//! assert!(CHECK_5);
//! assert!(CHECK_1009);
//! ```
//! The [`Primes`](crate::wrapper::Primes) type lets you reuse an array of already computed primes for primality testing.
//! ```
//! # use const_primes::wrapper::Primes;
//! const CACHE: Primes<100> = Primes::new();
//! const CHECK_42: Option<bool> = CACHE.is_prime(42);
//! const CHECK_541: Option<bool> = CACHE.is_prime(541);
//! const CHECK_1000: Option<bool> = CACHE.is_prime(1000);
//! assert_eq!(CHECK_42, Some(false));
//! assert_eq!(CHECK_541, Some(true));
//! assert_eq!(CHECK_1000, None);
//! ```
//! The function [`sieve::primalities`] lets you compute the prime status of many integers
//! ```
//! # use const_primes::sieve::primalities;
//! const PRIME_STATUS: [bool; 10] = primalities();
//! assert_eq!(PRIME_STATUS, [false, false, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false]);
//! ```
